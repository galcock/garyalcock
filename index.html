      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        I work at the intersection of <strong>private equity</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, and
        <strong>precision physics</strong>. My background is in leveraged buyouts, corporate divestitures,
        and special situations across industrials, manufacturing, and technology-driven services. In
        parallel, I pursue independent research on a scalar-field framework for gravity and light,
        <em>Density Field Dynamics (DFD)</em>, with concrete experimental proposals based on state-of-the-art
        optical clock systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am based in Los Angeles and hold a B.S. in Corporate Finance from the University of Southern California.

          <h3><a href="consulting.html" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:none;">Private equity and special situations</a></h3>
          <p>
            I have led and supported transactions across the full deal cycle: sourcing, diligence, structuring,
            and post-close value creation. Most of my work has been in industrials, manufacturing, and related
            services, including carve-outs and operationally intensive situations.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            Previous roles include Managing Director positions at Liberty Bay Capital and Revolution Capital Group,
            and advisory work at Houlihan Lokey. I have been involved in more than <strong>50 completed transactions</strong>
            with aggregate enterprise value in excess of <strong>$10 billion</strong>.

          <h3><a href="research.html" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:none;">Density Field Dynamics and precision tests</a></h3>
          <p>
            My research centers on <strong>Density Field Dynamics (DFD)</strong>, a scalar-refractive framework in which a
            field ψ(x) sets both the optical index and test-mass acceleration on flat ℝ³. The program is designed to
            be falsifiable with existing and near-term experiments.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            Current work includes PPN analysis, strong-field and gravitational-wave phenomenology, and proposals for
            sector-resolved <strong>cavity–atom comparisons</strong> and optical clock tests of Local Position Invariance.

        <article class="card">
          <h3><a href="research.html" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:none;">Optical clocks and LPI-style anomalies</a></h3>
          <p>
            I re-analyze long-baseline optical clock comparison data to examine whether photons and atoms respond
            identically to the same energy-density environment, and how to design experiments that cleanly test that
            question.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            This includes work with ROCIT-style datasets and proposed <strong>height-separated cavity–atom</strong> configurations
            that would isolate sector-dependent couplings beyond General Relativity.

          <h3><a href="research.html" style="color:inherit;text-decoration:none;">Augmented reality and game systems</a></h3>
          <p>
            On the technology side, I build augmented reality applications on Apple’s VisionOS stack, focusing on
            full-scene reconstruction, physically motivated shaders, and shared-world gameplay.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            Ongoing work includes an AR role-playing game with <strong>MMO-style interaction</strong> and real-world
            environment integration for Apple Vision Pro.

      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <p>
        Across finance, physics, and software, I try to keep the same principles: clear assumptions, explicit tests,
        and a bias toward concrete results. I am comfortable working with sponsors and operating teams on one side,
        and with experimentalists and theorists on the other.
