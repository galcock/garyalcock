            I work with private equity firms, independent sponsors, and founder-owners on
            <strong>proprietary deal flow</strong>, <strong>carve-out strategy</strong>, and
            <strong>complex transactions</strong> where both capital structure and operations
            matter.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Proprietary deal sourcing</h3>
          <p>
            Building and running sourcing programs that surface 2–8 qualified proprietary
            opportunities per month in tightly defined themes — without relying on broad auction
            processes.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            Focus: <strong>platforms and add-ons</strong> in industrials, manufacturing, and
            business services; careful alignment with each client’s underwriting discipline.

          <h3>Carve-outs &amp; complex situations</h3>
          <p>
            Corporate divestitures, messy separations, and situations where the heavy lift is
            operational and technical, not just financial.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            Support ranges from <strong>targeting and thesis formation</strong> to
            <strong>exec-ready carve-out plans</strong> and integration roadmaps.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Independent sponsor support</h3>
          <p>
            Helping independent sponsors and small funds present institutional-quality materials,
            refine their themes, and avoid wasting cycles on low-probability situations.
          </p>
          <p class="card-meta">
            Typical engagements: <strong>thematic build-outs</strong>, <strong>process design</strong>,

          <h3>Founder &amp; CEO advisory</h3>
          <p>
            Working directly with founder-owners considering a sale, recap, or growth capital

          <p class="card-meta">
            I’ve sat on both sides of the table and aim to make the process <strong>legible</strong>
